# Aadhaar-Authenticate

## Problem Statement:
### Airport / Stadium / Railway Station / Hotel Check-in Application:
How could we use Aadhaar services to create an application for smooth check-in to a Airport/Railway Station/Hotel etc ? Please remember that the Aadhaar number should not be shared with the verifier application. In addition, the verifier application should be assumed to have no access to UIDAI servers. The application should work offline and provide a sub-second end-to-end response time. 

## Solution:
### 2 apps to verify your Identity:
- Resident Application with the user to retrieve the Aadhaar data and create QR code.
- Verifier Application with the authenticator and receives data in encrypted form from the user and helps in easy paperless check-in.
